Project: Microservices Currency Exchange Application

    Overview:
        Architected and developed a microservices-based Currency Exchange application using Spring Cloud technologies.

    Key Components:
        Implemented Eureka Naming Server and Client for dynamic service discovery, enabling seamless communication between microservices.
        Utilized Spring Cloud Config Server to centrally manage and distribute configuration details across services.
        Integrated Spring Actuator for production-ready features, including health monitoring and metrics collection.
        Implemented Zipkin Tracing Server for distributed tracing, facilitating the identification of performance bottlenecks.

    Containerization and Deployment:
        Created Docker images to containerize the microservices, ensuring consistency and portability across environments.
        Pushed Docker images to Google Container Registry for efficient storage and distribution.

    Deployment on GCP Kubernetes Engine:
        Deployed the microservices on Google Cloud Platform's Kubernetes Engine (GKE), a managed Kubernetes service.
        Successfully orchestrated manual instance creation and demonstrated auto-scaling capabilities based on demand.

    Infrastructure as Code:
        Defined Kubernetes deployment configurations using YAML files, streamlining the deployment process and ensuring consistency.

    Technologies Used:
        Spring Cloud (Eureka, Config Server, Actuator)
        Docker for containerization
        Google Cloud Platform's Kubernetes Engine for orchestration
        Zipkin for distributed tracing

    Achievements:
        Achieved a seamless and scalable microservices architecture, enhancing the application's maintainability and performance.
        Demonstrated proficiency in containerization, orchestration, and cloud deployment technologies.

This project showcases my expertise in building and deploying microservices applications,leveraging modern technologies and best practices.
It also highlights my ability to design scalable and resilient architectures using Spring Cloud and Kubernetes on cloud platforms.
